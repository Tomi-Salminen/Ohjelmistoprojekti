# Ohjelmistoprojekti

The project is a website created for a company invented by a group of international business students. The company sells plants and flowers for other companies and offers a maintenance service to upkeep them. The website has the functionality to sign up and login with a username and a password. It is also possible to log in as an admin user to add or delete plants from the collection that the website showcases.

The team members are Ilari Ij√§s, Eero Kokkonen, Tomi Salminen and Marika Verger.
